# Task_Manager

every scripts has been setted up so that you dont need to rerun the server again and again

# cautions

Start the server before the UI renders as it makes the request on the intial render only

if you change port in the api , make sure to change it in the axios request as well

# setup

npm install and npm start in the server

similarly npm install and npm start in the client

# future propositions

apply types more resonably
form alerts
maybe api enchanement
